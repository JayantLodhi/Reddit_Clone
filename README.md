# Reddit Clone

A web application simulating Reddit-like functionality — posting, commenting, and voting — built with **Python** and **Flask**.

---

## 🧾 Overview

This project is a simplified **Reddit Clone** where users can:

- 📝 Create and view posts
- 💬 Comment on posts
- 👍 / 👎 Upvote and downvote posts or comments
- 🧭 Browse posts by popularity or recency
- 🔐 Login and manage user accounts

This project demonstrates **Flask routing**, **templating**, and **ORM**-based data handling with **MongoDB**— ideal for learning backend web development in Python.
